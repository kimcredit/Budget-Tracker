# Budget tracker
An application that allows the user to add expenses and deposits to their budget, with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they populate 
the total when back online.

## User Story 
```
AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling
```

## Functionality 
```
WHEN I visit the application
THEN I am presented with my current balance, recent withdrawals/ deposites, and a graph tracking my earnings and spending
WHEN I add a new withdrawal or deposit
THEN it updates my total, my recent display, and my tracking visual
WHEN I am offline and want to add a new withdrawal or deposit
THEN that transaction is stored and updates transaction history when my connection is back online
```
